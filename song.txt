Go ahead, you've take me down now.
Give me what you don't know.
Go ahead, take me all down now.
Get this, get this into your game.
You got me in a heady drop
I never wanna come off
You got me with your beat-up bluff
I never wanna come up

Think of me
I'll never break your heart
Think of me
You're always in the dark
I am your line, your line, your line
Think of me, You're never in the dark
